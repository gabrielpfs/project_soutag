# Code of Conduct

Our goal is to foster a welcoming, safe, and productive community for everyone.

## Expected Behavior
- Be respectful, inclusive, and professional in all interactions.
- Assume good intentions and seek to resolve conflicts constructively.
- Provide helpful, actionable feedback; focus on ideas, not individuals.
- Respect different skill levels, backgrounds, and cultures.
- Protect private information and follow our security practices.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech of any kind.
- Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments.
- Unwanted sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, sustained disruption, or spamming.
- Sharing others’ private information without explicit permission.
- Encouraging self-harm, illegal activity, or security violations.

## Reporting
If you observe or experience unacceptable behavior:
- Email the maintainers at **security@your-org.example** and **oss@your-org.example**.
- Include relevant details (what happened, when, where, links/screenshots if appropriate).

Reports are reviewed promptly and confidentially. Retaliation against reporters is prohibited.

## Enforcement
- First occurrence: reminder of this policy and guidance to improve.
- Continued issues or severe violations: temporary or permanent restriction from participation.
- The maintainers reserve the right to remove contributions, limit participation, or escalate to organizational authorities when necessary.

## Scope
This Code applies within all project spaces—GitHub issues, discussions, pull requests, code reviews, documentation, and community chats—as well as external representations where a participant claims affiliation with this project.

## Acknowledgments
This policy is inspired by widely used open-source community guidelines and adapted for this project’s needs.
